prerequisites :

sudo apt update

sudo apt install curl

sudo apt install sqlmap

git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git
cd XSStrike (i recommend putting the script in this directory and running it from there)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

sudo apt install openssl

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip



XSStrike likes to bug so if anything follow what the error message says. May need to set up a virtual enviroment and install fuzzywuzzy
